\section{Introduction}
%==================================
%==================================

This document is a practical user guide for \CS version \verscs.
It is the result of the joint effort of
all the members in the development team.

This document provides practical information for the usage of \CS.

The latest updated version of this document is available on-line with the version of \CS
and accessible through the command
\texttt{code\_saturne info --guide theory}.

This document presents some the necessary elements to run a calculation
with \CS version \verscs. It then lists all the variables of the code
which may be useful for more advanced users.
The user functions of all the modules within the code are then documented.
Eventually, for each keyword and user-modifiable parameter in the code,
their definition, allowed values, default values and conditions for use are given.
These keywords and parameters are grouped under headings
based on their function. An alphabetical index is also given at the end of
the document for easier reference.

In addition to the present user guide, a complete
\texttt{Doxygen} documentation is available with \CS. It can provide
information about the implementation such as details on variables used
throughout the solver and the user functions. It also provides an easily
explorable set of user function examples and Fortran-C naming references for
quantities linked to the mesh or the physical fields.

The user documentation is in the process of migration from this pdf documentation
to the Doxygen documentation, so the user should first lok there.
One can access the \texttt{Doxygen} main page through \doxygenfile{index.html}{this link} or from a terminal by typing the following command:
\texttt{code\_saturne info --guide theory}.

%==================================
\section{Advanced modelling setup}
%==================================

%==================================
\subsection{ALE module}
%==================================

%==================================
\subsubsection{Initialisation of the options}
%==================================
This initialisation can be performed in the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
 or in the function \texttt{cs\_user\_model} and \texttt{usstr1}. Firstly,
 when the ``Deformable mesh'' is selected in GUI under the ``Calculation features''
 heading, additional options are displayed. The user must choose the type of mesh
 viscosity and describe its spatial distribution, see \figurename~\ref{fig:Ini-ale}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{gui_ale_mei}
\caption{Thermophysical models - mobile mesh (ALE method)}
\label{fig:Ini-ale}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The following paragraphs are relevant if the GUI is not used.

\minititre{Function \texttt{cs\_user\_model}}
\noindent
\textit{Function called at the beginning.}
This function completes \texttt{cs\_user\_parameters.c}.

\texttt{cs\_user\_model} allows setting options for the ALE module, and in
particular to activate the ALE module (\texttt{cs\_glob\_ale = CS\_ALE\_LEGACY}).

\minititre{Function \texttt{usstr1}}

This function reads in \texttt{cs\_user\_fluid\_structure\_interaction.f90}. It allows to specify the following pieces of information for the structure module:
\begin{list}{-}{}
  \item the index of the structure, (\texttt{idfstr(ifac)} where \texttt{ifac} is the index of the face). Then the total number of structures \texttt{nbstru} is automatically computed by the code. Be careful, the value must belong to 1, ..., \texttt{nbstru}.
  \item the initial value of displacement, velocity and acceleration
    (\texttt{xstr0}, \texttt{xstreq} and \texttt{vstr0}).
\end{list}

Below is a list of the different variables that might be modified:

\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{}

\item{\texttt{idfstr(ifac)}} \\
{the index of the structure, (\texttt{idfstr(ifac)} where \texttt{ifac} is the index of the face), 0 if the face is not coupled to any structure.}

\item{\texttt{xstr0(i,k)}} \\
{initial position of a structure, where \texttt{i} is the dimension of space
and \texttt{k} the index of the structure}

\item{\texttt{xstreq(i,k)}} \\
{equilibrum position of a structure, where \texttt{i} is the dimension of space
and \texttt{k} the index of the structure}

\item{\texttt{vstr0(i,k)}} \\
{initial velicity of a structure, where \texttt{i} is the dimension of space
and \texttt{k} the index of the structure }
\end{list}

%==================================
\subsubsection{Mesh velocity boundary conditions}
%==================================
These boundary conditions can be managed through the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
 or using the function \texttt{usalcl} (called at each time step). With the GUI,
 when the item ``Deformable mesh'' is selected in ``Calculation features''
 the item ``coupling parameters'' appears under the heading ``Boundary conditions''.
 The user can choose a boundary condition type for ALE (internal coupling) see \figurename~
 \ref{fig:CL-ale1} and \figurename~\ref{fig:CL-ale2}.


\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{gui_ale_internal_bc_add}
\caption{Boundary conditions - internal coupling actived}
\label{fig:CL-ale1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{gui_ale_internal}
\caption{Boundary conditions - internal coupling}
\label{fig:CL-ale2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\minititre{Function \texttt{usalcl}}
When the GUI is not used, the use of \texttt{usalcl} is mandatory to run
a calculation using
the ale module just as it is in \texttt{cs\_user\_parameters.f90}. It is used the same way as
\texttt{cs\_user\_boundary\_conditions} in the framework of
standard calculations, that is to say a loop on the boundary faces
marked out by their colour (or more generally by a property of their
family), where the type of mesh velocity boundary condition is definied for
each variable.

The main numerical variables are described below.

\variab{ialtyb}{ialtyb(nfabor)}{ia}{In the ale module, the user
defines the mesh velocity from the colour of the boundary faces, or
more generally from their properties (colours, groups, ...), from the
boundary conditions defined in \texttt{cs\_user\_boundary\_conditions}, or even from their
coordinates. To do so, the array \texttt{ialtyb(nfabor)} gives for each face
\texttt{ifac} the mesh velocity boundary condition types marked out by the key
words \texttt{ivimpo\index{ivimpo}}, \texttt{igliss\index{igliss}},
\texttt{ibfixe\index{ibfixe}} or \texttt{ifresf\index{ifresf}}}.

\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{}

\item If \texttt{ialtyb(ifac) = ivimpo}: imposed velocity.

\begin{list}{$\rightarrow$}{}
\item In the cases where all the nodes of a face have a imposed displacement,
 it is not necessary to fill the tables with mesh velocity boundary conditions
 for this face, these will be erased. In the other case,
 the value of the Dirichlet must be given in \texttt{rcodcl(ifac,ivar,1)} for
 every value of \texttt{ivar} (\texttt{iuma}, \texttt{ivma} and \texttt{iwma}).
 The other boxes of \texttt{rcodcl} and \texttt{icodcl} are completed automatically.

 The tangential mesh velocity is taken like a tape speed under the
 boundary conditions of wall for the fluid, except if wall fluid velocity
 was specified by the user in the interface or \texttt{cs\_user\_boundary\_conditions} (in which case
 it is this speed which is considered).
\end{list}

 \item if \texttt{ialtyb(ifac) = ibfixe}: fixed wall
\begin{list}{$\rightarrow$}{}
 \item the velocity is null.
\end{list}

 \item if \texttt{ialtyb(ifac) = igliss}: sliding wall
\begin{list}{$\rightarrow$}{}
\item symmetry boundary condition on the mesh velocity vector, which means a homogeneous Neumann on the tangential mesh velocity and a zero Dirichlet on the normal mesh velocity.
\end{list}

 \item if \texttt{ialtyb(ifac) = ifresf}: free-surface
\begin{list}{$\rightarrow$}{}
\item an imposed mesh velocity such that the fluid mass flux is equal to the mesh displacement in order to mimic the free-surface automatically. Note that the boundary condition on the fluid velocity must be set separately (homogeneous Neumann condition for instance).
\end{list}

\end{list}

%==================================
\subsubsection{Modification of the mesh viscosity}
%==================================

The user function \texttt{cs\_user\_physical\_properties} can be used along the ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian
 Method) module, and allows modifying the mesh viscosity.
 It is called before the time loop, and before reading restart files
 (so the mesh is always in its initial position at this stage).
The user can modify mesh viscosity values to prevent cells and nodes from huge
 displacements in awkward areas, such as boundary layer for example.

Note that for more complex settings, the mesh viscosity could be modified in
 \texttt{cs\_user\_initialization} or \texttt{cs\_user\_extra\_operations}.
 The matching field's name is \texttt{mesh\_viscosity}.

%==================================
\subsubsection{Fluid - Structure internal coupling}\label{sec:ALE}
%==================================

In the function \texttt{cs\_user\_fluid\_structure\_interaction} the user provides the parameters of two other functions.
\texttt{usstr1} is called at the beginning of the calculation. It is used to define
 and initialise the internal structures where fluid-Structure coupling occurs.
For each boundary face \texttt{ifac}, \texttt{idfstr(ifac)} is the index of the structure
 the face belongs to (if \texttt{idfstr(ifac)} = 0, the face \texttt{ifac} doesn't belong
 to any structure). When using internal coupling, structure index necessarily must be
 strictly positive and smaller than the number of structures. The number of "internal" structures is automatically defined with the maximum
 value of the \texttt{idfstr} table, meaning that internal structure numbers must be defined
 sequentially with positive values, beginning with integer value '1'.

For each internal structure the user can define:
\begin{list}{-}{}
 \item an initial velocity \texttt{vstr0}
 \item an initial displacement \texttt{xstr0} ({\em i.e.} \texttt{xstr0} is the value of the
 displacement \texttt{xstr} compared to the initial mesh at time t = 0)
 \item a displacement compared to equilibrium  \texttt{xstreq} (i.e. \texttt{xstreq}
 is the initial displacement of the internal structure compared to its position at
 equilibrium; at each time step t and for a displacement \text{xstr}(t), the associated
 internal structure will undergo a force $-k*(\text{}t+XSTREQ)$ due to the spring).
\end{list}
\text{xstr0} and \text{vstr0} are initialised with the value 0.
When starting a calculation using ALE, or re-starting a calculation with ALE, based
 on a first calculation without ALE, an initial iteration 0 is automatically performed
 in order to take initial arrays \text{xstr0}, \text{vstr0} and \text{xstreq} into
 account. In any other case, add the following expression '\text{italin=1}' in function
 \text{usipsu}, so that the code can deal with the arrays \text{xstr0}, \text{vstr0} and \text{xstreq}.

When \texttt{ihistr} is set to 1, the code writes in the output the history of the
 displacement, of the structural velocity, of the structural acceleration and of the
 fluid force. The value of structural history output step is the same as the one for
 standard variables \text{nthist}.

The second function, \text{usstr2}, is called at each iteration. One defines in this
 function structural parameters (considered as potentially time dependent): {\em i.e.},
 mass m \text{xmstru}, friction coefficients c \text{xcstru}, and stiffness k \text{xkstru}.
 \text{forstr} array gives fluid stresses acting on each internal structure. Moreover it is also
 possible to take external forces (gravity for example ) into account.
\begin{list}{.}{}
 \item the \text{xstr} array indicates the displacement of the structure compared to its position in the initial mesh,
 \item the \text{xstr0} array gives the displacement of the structures in the initial mesh
 compared to structural equilibrium,
 \item the \text{vstr} array stands for structural velocity.
\end{list}
\text{xstr}, \text{xstr0} and \text{vstr} are \text{DATA} tables that can be used to
 define the  Mass, Friction and Stiffness arays. These are not to be modified.

The 3D structural equation that is solved is the following one:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:FluidStruct}
\displaystyle
\tens{m}.\partial_{tt}\vect{x}+\tens{c}.\partial_{t}\vect{x}+\tens{k}.\left(\vect{x}+\vect{x_0}\right)=\vect{f},
\end{equation}
where $x$ stands for the structural displacement compared to initial mesh position
 \text{xstr}, $x_0$ represents
 the displacement of the structure in initial mesh compared to equilibrium.
Note that $\tens{m}$,$\tens{c}$, and $\tens{k}$ are 3\text{x}3 matrices.
Equation \eqref{eq:FluidStruct} is solved using a Newmark HHT algorithm.
Note that the time step used to solve this equation, \text{dtstr}, can be
 different from the one of fluid calculations. The user is free to define \text{dtstr}
 array. At the beginning of the calculation \text{dtstr} is initialised to the value of
 \text{dtcel} (fluid time step).

%==================================
\subsection{Management of the structure property}
%==================================

The use of \texttt{usstr2} is mandatory to run a calculation using the ALE
 module with a structure module. It is called at each time step.

For each structure, the system that will be solved is:

\begin{equation}
M.x^{''}+C.x^{'}+K.(x-x_{0}) = 0
\end{equation}

where

\begin{list}{-}{}
 \item $M$ is the mass structure (\texttt{xmstru}).
 \item $C$ is the damping coefficient of the structure (\texttt{xcstru}).
 \item $K$ is the spring constant or force constant of the structure (\texttt{xkstru}).
 \item $x_{0}$ is the initial position.
\end{list}

Below is a list of the different variables that might be modified:

\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{}

\item{\texttt{xmstru(i,j,k})} \\
{mass matrix of the structure, where \texttt{i},\texttt{j} is
the array of mass structure and \texttt{k} the index of the structure.}

\item{\texttt{xcstru(i,j,k})}\\
{damping matrix coefficient of the structure, where \texttt{i},\texttt{j} is the array of
damping coefficient and \texttt{k} the index of the structure.}

\item{\texttt{xkstru(i,j,k)}}\\
{spring matrix constant of the structure, where \texttt{i},\texttt{j} is the array of spring
constant and \texttt{k} the index of the structure.}

\item{\texttt{forstr(i,k)}}\\
{force vector of the structure, where \texttt{i} is the force vector and
\texttt{k} the index of the structure.}
\end{list}

%===========================================================
\subsection{Management of the atmospheric module}
%===========================================================

This section describes how to set a calculation using the atmospheric module
of \CS. Each paragraph describes a step of the data setting process.

\subsubsection{Directory structure}\label{sec:atmo_struct}
%
The flowchart (\figurename~\ref{fig:organisation}) recalls the directory
structure of a study generated by \CS .
When using the atmospheric module, the structure is identical but a file called
\texttt{meteo} may be added to the data settings in order to provide vertical
profiles of the main variables. This file should be put in the \texttt{DATA}
directory. For more details about the \texttt{meteo} file, see \S~
~\ref{sec:atmo_BCs}).
%
\begin{figure}[ht]
 \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{gui_atmospheric_user_s_guide_v91.png}}
 \caption{Organization of a study (specific files of atmospheric version in bold type)}
 \label{fig:organisation}
\end{figure}
%
\subsubsection{The atmospheric mesh features}
%
An atmospheric mesh has the following specific features:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item The boundary located at the top of the domain should be a plane.
So, horizontal wind speed at a given altitude can be prescribed at the top
face as an inlet boundary.
\item Cells may have very different sizes, from very small (near ground or
buildings) to very large (near the top of domain or far from zone of interest).
\item Vertical resolution: from tiny cells (e.g. $\Delta $\upshape z = 1 m) near
the ground to a few hundreds of meters at the top.
\item Horizontal resolution: from a few meters to hundreds of meters.
\item The length ratio between two adjacent cells (in each direction) should
preferably be between $0.7$ and $1.3$.
\item The z axis represents the vertical axis.
\end{itemize}
%
A topography map can be used to generate a mesh. In this case, the preprocessor
 mode is particularly useful to check the quality of the mesh (run type Mesh
quality criteria).
%
\subsubsection{Atmospheric flow model and steady/unsteady algorithm}
%
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) may be used to enable the atmospheric flow
module and set up the following calculation parameters in the
\texttt{Thermophysical models}-\texttt{Calculation features} page
(see \figurename~\ref{fig:steady}):
%
\subsubsubsection{The atmospheric flow model}
%
The user can choose one of the following atmospheric flow models:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Constant density}: To simulate neutral atmosphere.
\item \textbf{Dry atmosphere}: To simulate dry, thermally-stratified
atmospheric flows (enables \texttt{Potential temperature} as thermal model).
\item \textbf{Humid atmosphere}: To simulate thermally stratified atmospheric
flows (air-water mixture) with phase changes (enables \texttt{Liquid potential
temperature} as thermal model). The model is described in
Bouzereau \cite{bouzereau}.
\end{itemize}
%
\subsubsubsection{The time algorithm}
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Steady flow algorithm: is the one usually set. It sets a time step
variable in space and time. It has to be selected if constant boundary
conditions are used.
\item Unsteady flow algorithm has to be selected for time varying boundary
conditions (the time step can then be variable in time or constant).
\end{itemize}
%
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{gui_atmospheric_user_s_guide_v92.png}}
\caption{Selection of atmospheric model}
\label{fig:steady}
\end{figure}
%
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{gui_atmospheric_user_s_guide_v93.png}}
\caption{Selection of steady/unsteady flow algorithm}
\label{fig:global}
\end{figure}
%
Table \tablename~\ref{tab:param_list} can help to choose the right parameters
depending on the type of atmospheric flow.
%
\subsubsubsection{Warnings}
The following points have to be considered when setting the parameters
described above:
\begin{itemize}
\item The potential temperature thermal model and the liquid potential
temperature one (see the paragraph ``Atmospheric main variables'' for the
definition) requires that the vertical component of the gravity is set to
$g_z=-9.81 m.s^{-2}$ ($g_x=g_y=0 m.s^{-2}$),
otherwise pressure and density won't be correctly computed.
\item As well, the use of scalar with drift for atmospheric dispersion requires
the gravity to be set to $g_z=-9.81$ ($g_x=g_y=0 m.s^{-2}$), even if the density
is constant.
\end{itemize}
%
\subsubsection{Physical properties}
%
The specific heat value has to be set to the atmospheric value
$C_{p}=1005 J/kg/K$.
%
\begin{table}[ht]\label{tab:param_list}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{80pt}|p{70pt}|p{70pt}|p{80pt}|p{100pt}|}
\hline
\textbf{Parameters} & \textbf{Constant density} & \textbf{Dry atmosphere} & \textbf{Humid atmosphere} & \textbf{Explanation} \\
\hline
pressure boundary condition & Neumann first order & Extrapolation & Extrapolation &
In case of \textbf{Extrapolation}, the pressure gradient is assumed (and set) constant, whereas in case of \textbf{Neumann first order},
the pressure gradient is assumed (and set) to zero. \\
\hline
Improved pressure interpolation in stratified flows & no & yes & yes & If yes, exact balance between the hydrostatic part of the pressure gradient and the gravity term $\rho g$ is numerically ensured. \\
\hline
Gravity (gravity is assumed aligned with the z-axis) & $g_z=0$ or $g_z=-9.81 m.s^{-2}$ (the latter is useful for scalar with drift) & $g_z=-9.81 m.s^{-2}$ & $g_z=-9.81 m.s^{-2}$ &  \\
\hline
Thermal variable & no & potential temperature & liquid potential temperature &  \\
\hline
Others variables & no & no & total water content, droplets number &  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\label{tab1}
\caption[List of parameters]{List of parameters}
\end{center}
\end{table}
%
\subsubsection{Boundary and initial conditions}\label{sec:atmo_BCs}
%
The \texttt{meteo} file can be used to define initial conditions for the
different fields and to set up the inlet boundary conditions. For the velocity
field, \CS can automatically detect if the boundary is an inlet boundary or an
outflow boundary, according to the wind speed components given in the
\texttt{meteo} file with respect to the boundary face orientation. This is often
used for the lateral boundaries of the atmospheric domain, especially if the
profile is evolving in time. In the case of inlet flow, the data given in the
\texttt{meteo} file will be used as the input data (Dirichlet boundary condition)
for velocity, temperature, humidity and turbulent variables. In the case of
outflow, a Neumann boundary condition is automatically imposed (except for the
pressure). The unit of temperature in the \texttt{meteo} file is the degree
Celsius whereas the unit in the GUI is the kelvin.

To be taken into account, the \texttt{meteo} file has to be selected in the GUI
(\texttt{Atmospheric flows} page, see \figurename~\ref{fig:meteo}) and the check
box on the side ticked. This file gives the profiles of prognostic atmospheric
variables containing one or a list of time stamps. The file has to be put in the
\texttt{DATA} directory.
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{gui_atmo_read.png}}
\caption{Selection of the \texttt{meteo} file}
\label{fig:meteo}
\end{figure}
%
An example of file \texttt{meteo} is given in the directory
\texttt{data/user/meteo}. The file format has to be strictly respected.
The horizontal coordinates are not used at the present time (except when
boundary conditions are based on several meteorological vertical profiles)
and the vertical profiles are defined with the altitude above sea level. The
highest altitude of the profile should be above the top of the simulation domain
and the lowest altitude of the profile should be below or equal to the lowest
level of the simulation domain. The line at the end of the \texttt{meteo} file
should not be empty.

If the boundary conditions are variable in time, the vertical profiles for
the different time stamps have to be written sequentially in the \texttt{meteo}
file.

You can also set the profiles of atmospheric variables directly in the GUI.
The following boundary conditions can be selected in the GUI:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Inlet/Outlet is automatically calculated for lateral boundaries
(e.g. North, West\textellipsis ) of the computational domain
(see \figurename~\ref{fig:inlet}).
\item Inlet for the top of the domain (see \figurename~\ref{fig:top}).
\item Rough wall for building walls (see \figurename~\ref{fig:walls}) or for
the ground (see \figurename~\ref{fig:ground}).
The user has to enter the roughness length. In case of variable roughness
length, the user has to provide the land use data and the association
between the roughness length values and land use categories.
\end{itemize}
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{gui_atmospheric_user_s_guide_v95.png}}

%

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{gui_atmospheric_user_s_guide_v98.png}}
\caption{Selection of the boundary condition for the ground}
\label{fig:ground}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Remark:} If a meteorological file is given, it is used by default to
initialize the variables. If a meteorological file is not given, the user can
use the standard \CS initial and boundary conditions set up but has to be aware
that even small inconsistencies can create very large buoyancy forces and
spurious circulations.

\subsubsubsection{Boundary conditions based on several meteorological vertical profiles}

In some cases, especially when outputs of a mesoscale model are used, you
need to build input boundary conditions from several meteorological vertical
wind profiles. Cressman interpolation is then used to create the boundary
conditions. The following files need to be put in the \texttt{DATA} directory:
\begin{itemize}
\item All \texttt{meteo} files giving the different vertical profiles of
prognostic variables (wind, temperature, turbulent kinetic energy and
dissipation).
\item A file called \texttt{imbrication\_files\_list.txt} which is a list
of the \texttt{meteo} files used.
\item A separate \texttt{meteo} file which is used for the initial conditions
and to impose inlet boundary conditions for the variables for which Cressman
interpolation is not used (for example: temperature, turbulent kinetic energy).
This file must follow the rules indicated previously.
\end{itemize}
The following files should be put in the SRC directory:
\begin{itemize}
\item The user source file \texttt{cs\_user\_parameters.f90}. In this file, set
the \texttt{cressman\_} flag of each variable, for which the Cressman
interpolation should be enabled, to \texttt{.true.}.
\end{itemize}
%
\subsubsection{User functions}
%
The user functions are used when the graphical user interface is not
sufficient to set up the calculation. We give some examples of user file for
atmospheric application:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{cs\_user\_source\_terms.c}: to add a source term in the
prognostic equations for forest canopy modelling, wind turbine wake modelling...
%See the associated \doxygenfile{cs_user_source_terms.html}{\texttt{doxygen} documentation}.
for examples of use of \texttt{cs\_user\_source\_terms.c}.
\item \texttt{cs\_user\_parameters.f90}: to activate the Cressman interpolation.
For example, it is used to impose inhomogeneous boundary conditions.% See the associated
%\doxygenfile{f_parameters.html}{\texttt{doxygen} documentation}.
for examples of use of \texttt{cs\_user\_parameters.f90}.
\item \texttt{cs\_user\_extra\_operations.c}: to generate vertical
profiles for post processing. %See the associated
%\doxygenfile{cs_user_extra_operations_examples.html}{\texttt{doxygen} documentation}.
for examples of use of \texttt{cs\_user\_extra\_operations-mean\_profiles.c}
\item \texttt{cs\_user\_boundary\_conditions.f90}: show how to set
up the boundary conditions and to put a heterogeneous roughness length...
%See the associated \doxygenfile{cs_user_boundary_conditions_examples.html}{\texttt{doxygen}
%documentation}.
for examples of use of \texttt{cs\_user\_boundary\_conditions-atmospheric.f90}.
\end{itemize}
%
\paragraph{Remark:}
If the computation is set without the GUI, other user functions such as the
following have to be used:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{cs\_user\_initialization.c}: allows to initialize
or modify (in case of a restarted calculation) the calculation variables and
the values of the time step. %See the associated \doxygenfile{user_initialization.html}{\texttt{doxygen} documentation}.
\\for examples of use of \texttt{cs\_user\_initialization-atmospheric.c}
\item \texttt{cs\_user\_boundary\_conditions-atmospheric.f90}: allows to define
all the boundary conditions. For each type of boundary condition, faces should
be grouped as physical zones characterized by an arbitrary number \texttt{izone}
chosen by the user. If a boundary condition is retrieved from a meteorological
profile, the variable \texttt{iprofm(izone)} of the zone has to be set to 1.
The vertical profiles of atmospheric variables can be described in this file.
\end{itemize}
%
Examples are available in the directory \texttt{SRC/USER\_EXAMPLE}.
%
\subsubsection{Physical models}

\subsubsubsection{Atmospheric dispersion of pollutants}
%
To simulate the atmospheric dispersion of pollutant, one first need to define
the source(s) term(s). That is to say the location i.e. the list of cells or
boundary faces, the total air flow, the emitted mass fraction of pollutant,
the emission temperature and the speed with the associated turbulent parameters.
The mass fraction of pollutant is simulated through a user added scalar that
could be a `scalar with drift' if wanted (aerosols for example).

The simulations can be done using 3 different methods:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using a mass source term, that is added in the Navier-Stokes
equations using the \texttt{cs\_user\_mass\_source\_terms.f90} user function.

\item Prescribing a boundary condition code ``total imposed mass flux`` for
some boundary faces using the \texttt{cs\_user\_boundary\_conditions.f90} user
function.

\item Using a scalar source term. In this case, the air inflow is not taken
into account. The user has to add an explicit part to the equations
for the scalar through the \texttt{cs\_user\_source\_terms.c} file. This is
done by selecting the cells and adding the source term \texttt{st\_exp (cells)}
which equals to the air flux multiplied by the mass fraction, while the
implicit part \texttt{st\_imp} is set to zero.
\end{enumerate}

The first method is recommended, but one must take care that each source
influences the dispersion of the others, which is physically realistic. So
if the impact of several sources has to be analyzed independently it has first
to be verified that these influences are negligible or as many simulations
as there are sources have to be run.

With the second method, the same problem of sources interactions appears, and
moreover standard Dirichlet conditions should not be used (use
\texttt{itypfb=i\_convective\_inlet} and \texttt{icodcl=13} instead) as
the exact emission rate cannot be prescribed because the diffusive part
(usually negligible) cannot be quantified. Additionally, it requires that
the boundary faces of the emission are explicitly represented in the mesh.

Finally the third method does not take into account the jet effect of the
emission and so must be used only if it is sure that the emission does not
modify the flow.

Whatever solution is chosen, the mass conservation should be verified by using
for example the
\texttt{cs\_user\_extra\_operations-scalar\_balance.c} file.

\subsubsubsection{Soil/atmosphere interaction model}

This model is based on the force restore model (Deardorff \cite{deardorff}).
It takes into account heat and humidity exchanges between the ground and the
atmosphere at daily scale and the time evolution of ground surface temperature
and humidity. Surface temperature is calculated with a prognostic equation
whereas a 2-layers model is used to compute surface humidity.

The parameter \texttt{iatsoil} in the file \texttt{atini0.f90} needs to be equal to one to
activate the model. Then, the source file \texttt{solvar.f90} is used.

Three variables need to be initialized in the file \texttt{atini0.f90}: deep soil
temperature, surface temperature and humidity.

The user needs to give the values of the model constants in the file
\texttt{solcat.f90}: roughness length, albedo, emissivity...

In case of a 3D simulation domain, land use data has to be provided for the domain.
Values of model constants for the land use categories have also to be
provided.

\subsubsubsection{Radiative model (1D)}

The 1D-radiative model calculates the radiative exchange between different
atmospheric layers and the surface radiative fluxes.

The radiative exchange is computed separately for two wave lengths intervals

\begin{itemize}
\item Calculation in the infrared spectral domain (file \texttt{rayir.f90})
\item Calculation in the spectral range of solar radiation (file
\texttt{rayso.f90})
\end{itemize}
This 1D-radiative model is needed if the soil/atmosphere interaction model
is activated.

This model is activated if the parameter \texttt{iatra1} is equal to one in the
file \texttt{cs\_users\_parameters.f90}.

\subsubsection{Recommendations}\label{subsubsec:recommendations}
%
This part is a list of recommendations for atmospheric numerical simulations.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Enough probes at different vertical levels in the domain should be used
to check the convergence of the calculation.
\item An inflow boundary condition at the top level of the domain should be set
(symmetry and automatic inlet/outlet are not appropriate).
\item A Courant number too small or too big has to be avoided (see \CS Best
Practice Guidelines). That is the reason why the option \texttt{variable time
step in space and in time} is recommended for steady simulations when there are
large differences of cell size inside the domain (which is generally the case
for atmospheric simulations). With this option, it can be necessary to change
the reference time step and the time step maximal increase (by default, the time
step increase rate is $10\%$).
\end{itemize}
%
In some cases, results can be improved with the following modifications:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item In some case, the turbulent eddy viscosity can drop to unrealistically low
values (especially with $k-\varepsilon$ model in stable atmospheric condition).
In those cases, it is suggested to put an artificial molecular viscosity around
$0.1 m^{2}.s^{-1}$.
\item If the main direction of wind is parallel to the boundary of your computing
domain, try to set symmetry boundary conditions for the lateral boundaries to
avoid inflow and outflow on the same boundary zone (side of your domain).
Another possibility is to use a cylindrical mesh.
\item To avoid inflow and outflow on the same boundary zone (side of your domain),
avoid the case of vertical profile in the input data \texttt{meteo} file with
changes of the sign of velocity of wind ($V_x$ or/and $V_y$).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Turbomachinery computations}
%==================================

\subsubsection{Introduction}

Two classical models are available in \CS for rotor/stator
interactions modelling in turbomachinery computations: the steady
approach which is based on the so-called \emph{Frozen Rotor} modelling
and the \emph{transient rotor/stator} approach which is based on a
sliding mesh technique.

\underline{\emph{Warning:}} This section describes these functionalities based on
a single \CS computation. An alternative rotor/stator coupling based
on coupling of boundary conditions is also possible (and only briefly
described in this section) but it is not recommended.

\subsubsection{Meshing reccomendations}\label{tbm_mesh}

\paragraph{Periodicity}\label{tbm_mesh_perio}

The rotational periodicity treatment is possible only in \emph{Frozen
Rotor}. However, the interface plane between rotor and stator
must match in the azimutal $\theta$ direction:
$$\theta_{\text{min}}^{\text{rotor}}(z)=\theta_{\text{min}}^{\text{stator}}(z),\quad\theta_{\text{max}}^{\text{rotor}}(z)=\theta_{\text{max}}^{\text{stator}}(z)$$
for all $z$ through the rotation axis direction.

\paragraph{Rotor/stator interface}\label{tbm_mesh_interface}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Unsteady rotor/stator}: in the input mesh(es), the
  interface between rotor and stator domains has to be composed of
  \underline{boundary faces}. Then the interface boundary faces are joined
  during the computation and become internal faces, as is usual for
  mesh joining in the preprocessing stage. A simple way to ensure
  joining is not done prematurely is to provide
  \underline{separated meshes} for each rotor or stator domain.
\item \emph{Frozen Rotor}: the interface can be composed of boundary
   faces (in which case the interface boundary faces are joined at
   the beginning of the computation) or of internal faces.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Meshing of the interface region}\label{tbm_user_bpg_mesh}

As mentioned above, when a rotor/stator interface boundary exists (in
particular for the \emph{unsteady rotor/stator} model), boundary faces
are joined by the solver during the computation, based on the current
rotor position. It is thus important to be aware that the success of
a joining operation is strongly dependant on the
\underline{quality of the mesh at the interface}. More precisely,
the refinement must be as similar as possible at both sides of the
interface. Moreover, it is reminded that the tolerance parameter of
a joining is a fraction of the shortest edge linked with a vertex of
a joined face. Consequently, cells with high aspect ratios where the
refinement in the azimutal $\theta$ direction is much coarser than
those in one of the two others can also lead to a joining failure.
In particular, the user should be careful to avoid elongated
viscous layer type cells in curved areas such as a rotor-stator interface.

If the meshes at both sides of the interface are very different
such that the joining fails, advanced joining parameters are
available. However, modifying the mesh is more likely to
succeed. The introduction of a somekind of buffer cells layer on
both sides of the interface should be very valuable. Ideally, each
of the two layers should have the same refinement and a constant
azimutal step (this latter recommandation is relevant only for
\emph{unsteady rotor/stator} model).

\paragraph{Alternative rotor/stator coupling}\label{tbm_user_bpg_cpl}

If the meshes at both sides of the interface are very different and
can not be modified, a fallback solution is to use the rotor/stator model
based on the boundary conditions coupling.

\underline{\emph{Warning:}} Contrarily to the mesh joining approach, the
boundary conditions coupling approach is not fully conservative.

\subsubsection{Turbomachinery dedicated postprocessing functions}\label{tbm_user_post}

Useful postprocessing functions relative to the machinery
characteristics are available: postprocessing of the couple on the
rotor walls and postprocessing of the head generated by the machinery.

\subsubsection{Data setting, keywords and examples}\label{tbm_date_setting}
Data setting, keywords and examples for turbomachinery computations
(mesh joining or boundary conditions coupling), are provided in
\doxygenfile{turbomachinery.html}{the dedicated \texttt{doxygen}
documentation}.

\subsection{Cavitation module}
%==================================

The cavitation module is based on an homogeneous mixture model. The
physical properties (density and dynamic viscosity) of the mixture
depends on a resolved void fraction and constant reference properties
of the liquid phase and the gas phase.

For a description of the user management of the cavitation module,
please refer to \doxygenfile{cavit.html}{the dedicated
  \texttt{doxygen} documentation}.
