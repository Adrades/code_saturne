\section{Introduction}
%==================================
%==================================

This document is a practical user guide for \CS version \verscs.
It is the result of the joint effort of
all the members in the development team.

This document provides practical information for the usage of \CS.

The latest updated version of this document is available on-line with the version of \CS
and accessible through the command
\texttt{code\_saturne info --guide theory}.

This document presents some the necessary elements to run a calculation
with \CS version \verscs. It then lists all the variables of the code
which may be useful for more advanced users.
The user functions of all the modules within the code are then documented.
Eventually, for each keyword and user-modifiable parameter in the code,
their definition, allowed values, default values and conditions for use are given.
These keywords and parameters are grouped under headings
based on their function. An alphabetical index is also given at the end of
the document for easier reference.

In addition to the present user guide, a complete
\texttt{Doxygen} documentation is available with \CS. It can provide
information about the implementation such as details on variables used
throughout the solver and the user functions. It also provides an easily
explorable set of user function examples and Fortran-C naming references for
quantities linked to the mesh or the physical fields.

The user documentation is in the process of migration from this pdf documentation
to the Doxygen documentation, so the user should first lok there.
One can access the \texttt{Doxygen} main page through \doxygenfile{index.html}{this link} or from a terminal by typing the following command:
\texttt{code\_saturne info --guide theory}.

%\subsection{Cooling tower modelling}
%==================================

%==================================
%\subsubsection{Parameters}
%==================================

%\noindent
%\textit{Function called only during calculation initialisation? OR AT EACH ITERATION?.}

%The function \texttt{uscti1} contains calculation parameters such as:
%\begin{list}{-}{}
% \item  temperature parameters,
% \item  the number of exchange zones at various locations,
% \item  the air properties.
%\end{list}

%==================================
%\subsubsection{Initialisation of the variables}
%==================================

%With the additional variables introduced with the air-cooling module, the
%following quantities may be initialized by  \texttt{cs\_user\_initialization} in
%user selected zones in addition to the usual quantities:
%\begin{list}{-}{}
% \item the air temperature, variable of index \texttt{isca(ihumid)},
% \item the air humidity, variable of index \texttt{isca(itemp4)},
%\end{list}
%where \texttt{iel} can be an element found in a list returned by the routine
% '\texttt{getcel}'.

%==================================
%\subsubsection{Definition of the exchange zones}
%==================================

%The function \texttt{usctdz} is used to define the exchange zones of a cooling
% tower. The user provides the following parameters:
%\begin{list}{-}{}
% \item \texttt{imzech}: its value is related to the model used:
%      \begin{list}{$\rightarrow$}{}
%       \item 0: no model is used,
%       \item 1: Merkel model is used,
%       \item 2: Poppe model is used,
%      \end{list}
% \item 10 exchange zone parameters.
%\end{list}
%These arguments are passed to the function '\texttt{defct}' along with a
%geometrical selection criterion.
