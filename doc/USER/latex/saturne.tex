with \CS\ version \verscs. It then lists all the variables of the code
which may be useful for more advanced utilisation.
The user subroutines of all the modules within the code are also documented.
Eventually, for each key word and user-modifiable parameter in the code,
their definition, allowed values, default values and conditions for use are given.
These key words and parameters are grouped under headings
based on their function. An alphabetical index list is also given at the end of
the document for easier consultation.}
